We want to implement a GPU based PBD fluid simulation stable enough to support 
large time steps for real-time applications. Through the enforcement of constant 
density positional constraints, the simulation will allow for incompressibility 
and convergence similar to smooth particle hydro-dynamic solvers. Our project 
will be largely based on Muller and Macklin’s paper “Position Based Fluids”.

-----

##Proposed Features:
*   Particle-based position based dynamics fluid simulator that runs on the GPU
*   Uses the density constraint to enforce incompressibility
*   Artificial pressure term to simulate surface tension
*   Vorticity confinement to replace energy
*   Viscosity term
*   GPU Hash Grid for optimization of finding particle neighbors
*   Meshless rendering (bilateral Gaussian or curvature flow)

-------

##Tentative Schedule
* Mon, 11/25 (Alpha) 
 + Setting up framework for constraint and particle system
 + Set up visualization for particles 
* Mon, 12/9 (Last day of class)
 + begin writing paper
 + Simulator with position based dynamics finished
 + GPU hash grid
* Due date (Final)
 + Meshless rendering finished 
 + Paper finished
